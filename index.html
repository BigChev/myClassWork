	<h1>A Look Into My Life</h1>
	<p>When I have ideas my mind starts to race. I need to write everything. Alot of things that I have on my mind is relatable to many everyday poeple. My ideas are not always what I am feeling. I just empathise with other people a lot. This is my house and also where I write most of my poems. It is my comfort</p>
